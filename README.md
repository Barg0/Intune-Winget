# Intune App Deployment with Winget

This repository combines two script-based approaches for managing applications with **Winget** in **Microsoft Intune**:

1. **Win32 - App Deployment** – Deploy individual applications using `Win32 Apps`.
2. **Remediation Script - Winget App Update** – Automatically update a list of applications.

## 🚀 How It Works

* Use **Win32 - App Deployment** to publish the app to `Microsoft Intune`.
* Use **Remediation Script - Winget App Update** to patch the deployed `Win32 Apps`.
